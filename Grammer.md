A noun is a word that refers to a person, place, or thing. The category of “things” may sound super vague, 
but in this case it means inanimate objects, abstract concepts, and activities. Phrases and other parts of speech can also 
behave like nouns and can be the subject in a sentence, as in Jogging is a fun exercise. Here, the verb jogging acts like a noun and
is the subject of the sentence.

##Proper Noun: 
```
Proper nouns help distinguish a specific person, place, or thing. These words should be capitalized. 
The names and titles of things are always proper nouns, such as the brand name Starbucks and the personal name Jenny.

Names of people, places or organizations are proper nouns. Your name is a proper noun. London is a proper noun. United Nations is a proper noun.

Rule: Proper nouns always start with a capital letter.

Examples: Jane, Thailand, Sunday, James Bond, Einstein, Superman, Game of Thrones, Shakespeare

Let me introduce you to Mary.
The capital of Italy is Rome.
He is the chairman of the British Broadcasting Corporation.
I was born in November.
Note: Adjectives that we make from proper nouns also usually start with a capital letter, for example Shakespearian, Orwellian.
```
## Common Noun
```
Common nouns are words that refer to undefined or generic people, places, or things. For example, 
the country is a common noun that refers to a generic place while the word Canada is not a common noun because it refers to a specific place. 
Common nouns are only capitalized when they begin sentences or are used in the names or titles of something, as in Grand Canyon or Iron Man.

common nouns:
house, cat, girl, foot, country
Most nouns are common nouns. Common nouns refer to people, places and things in general like chair or dog. Any noun that is not a name is a common noun.

Examples: teacher, car, music, danger, receipt

Have you seen my dog?
The books are on your desk.
the pursuit of happiness.
```
## Abstract Noun
```
Abstract nouns are the opposite of concrete nouns. They are things that you cannot touch. Abstract nouns are ideas, concepts and feelings.

Examples: happiness, courage, danger, truth

He has great strength.
Who killed President Kennedy is a real mystery.
Sometimes it takes courage to tell the truth.
Their lives were full of sadness.
```
## Concrete Noun
```
Concrete nouns are physical things that you can touch.

Examples: man, rice, head, car, furniture, mobile phone

How many stars are there in the universe?
Have you met James Bond?
Pour the water down the drain.
```
## Countable 
```
(also called count nouns)

You can count countable nouns. Countable nouns have singular and plural forms.
Examples:  ball, boy, cat, person

I have only five dollars.
The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago.
There are lots of people but we don't have a car.
```
## Uncountable Nouns
```
(also called mass nouns)

You cannot count uncountable nouns. You need to use "measure words" to quantify them.

Rule: We never use uncountable nouns with the indefinite article (a/an). Uncountable nouns are always singular.

Examples: water, happiness, cheese

Have you got some money?
Air-conditioners use a lot of electricity.
Do you have any work for me to do?
Many Asians eat rice.
```
## Collective Noun
```
A collective noun denotes a group of individuals.

Examples: class (group of students), pride (group of lions), crew (group of sailors)

Rule: Collective nouns can be treated as singular or plural. More about this at rules of subject-verb agreement with collective nouns.

An average family consists of four people.
The new company is the result of a merger.
The board of directors will meet tomorrow.
```
## Compound Noun
```
A compound noun is a noun that is made with two or more words. Most compound nouns are [noun + noun] or [adjective + noun]. Each compound noun acts as a single unit and can be modified by adjectives and other nouns.

Compound nouns have three different forms:

open or spaced - space between words (bus stop)
hyphenated - hyphen between words (mother-in-law)
closed or solid - no space or hyphen between words (football)
Examples: cat food, blackboard, breakfast, full moon, washing machine, software

Can we use the swimming pool?
They stop work at sunset.
Don't forget that check-out is at 12 noon.
